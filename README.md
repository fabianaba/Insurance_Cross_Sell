## 1. Business problem

Insurance All is a fictitious insurance company that traditionally has provided Health Insurance now intends to offer its customers a new product, a Vehicle Insurance. In order to achieve this purpose efficiently, it gathered some information about their current customers and asked if they would be interested in purchasing a new vehicle insurance. The dataset features are:

* __id__: Unique ID for the customer.
* __Gender__: Gender of the customer.
* __Age__: Age of the customer
* __Driving License__: Whether the customer has a driving license or not.
* __Region Code__: Unique code for the location of the customer.
* __Previously Insured__: Whether the customer already has a vehicle insurance or not.
* __Vehicle Age__: Age of the vehicle.
* __Vehicle Damage__: Whether the vehicle has suffered damage in the past or not.
* __Annual Premium__: The amount paid by the customer annually.
* __Policy Sales Channel__: Anonymized code for the channel of outreaching the customer.
* __Vintage__: Amount of time (in days) since the customer is associated with the company.
* __Response__: Whether the customer is interested in purchasing the vehicle insurance or not.

The company has hired a Data Science consulting firm to define a data-driven marketing strategy to sell the new product by clarifying some questions:

1. Among all the features gathered, which ones show more evidence of intent of the customers to purchase a car insurance?

2. If the team sales is able to make 20.000 calls to offer the new product, which fraction of the customers would be reached?

3. If the sales team is now able to make 40.000 calls, which fraction of the customers would be reached?

4. How many calls does the sales team need to make in order to reach 80\% of the interested customers?

In order to answer these questions, the machine learning model must inform the probability that each client would purchase the vehicle insurance, and the database must be sorted by this information. Having the clients with higher probabilities ranked on top, the questions above could be addressed.
